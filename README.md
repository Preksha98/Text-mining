Project Overview:
This project aims to develop a text mining system that can classify product descriptions into their respective companies using a Random Forest classifier. The system processes textual data, extracts relevant features, and applies machine learning techniques to predict the company associated with each product description.

Key Components:

Data Collection:

Gather a dataset containing product descriptions along with their corresponding company labels.
Sources can include e-commerce websites, company product catalogs, or datasets from platforms like Kaggle.
Data Preprocessing:

Text Cleaning: Remove special characters, numbers, and punctuations.
Tokenization: Split text into individual words or tokens.
Stop Words Removal: Remove common stop words that do not contribute to distinguishing product descriptions.
Stemming/Lemmatization: Reduce words to their base or root form to normalize the text data.
Feature Extraction:

Bag of Words (BoW): Convert text data into a fixed-length vector by counting word occurrences.
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Transform text data to reflect the importance of words in a document relative to the entire corpus.
N-grams: Consider sequences of N words to capture context and improve prediction accuracy.
Model Training:

Random Forest Classifier: Train a Random Forest classifier on the extracted features. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes for classification tasks.
Train-Test Split: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Perform cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness and generalizability.
Prediction:

Use the trained Random Forest classifier to predict the company for new product descriptions.
Implement a user-friendly interface where users can input product descriptions and get predictions.
